  <h2>
    <strong><u>Rules of The Resistance</u></strong>
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The game requires between five and ten players.</li>
    <li>
      Approximately one third of the players are randomly chosen as spies; the
      rest are members of the Resistance.
    </li>
    <li>
      The spies know who the other spies are, but Resistance members do not.
    </li>
    <li>The game consists of up to five missions.</li>
    <li>
      Each mission has a leader. The leader proposes a mission team of a certain
      size, which the group approves by public vote.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the group does not approve the mission by a simple majority, leadership
      passes to the next player.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the group cannot approve a mission team after five attempts, the spies
      win.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once a mission team is chosen, it votes by secret ballot whether the
      mission succeeds or fails.
    </li>
    <li>
      Resistance members will always vote for success, but spies have the option
      of voting for success or failure.
    </li>
    <li>
      It usually only takes one spy on the mission team to sabotage a mission,
      but sometimes the fourth mission requires two.
    </li>
    <li>
      If three missions succeed, the Resistance wins. If three fail, the spies
      win.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>And finally, the last, but most important rule of all:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You are allowed to say anything, to any one, at any time -- as long as it
      is said publicly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Additionally, there are two rule variants:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Original Resistance</strong>: At the beginning of the first round
      of every mission, the leader distributes a number of plot cards from a
      shuffled deck to other players. These plot cards can be used to reveal
      additional pieces of information to certain players or to the entire
      group.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resistance: Avalon</strong>: One of the Resistance players
      (designated "Merlin") is told who the spies are. He can use this knowledge
      to help his teammates, but beware -- the spies musn't figure out who
      Merlin is! At the end of the game, one of the spies (designated "the
      Assassin") is allowed to kill off one Resistance player; if he picks
      Merlin, the spies win!
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>
    <strong><u>Site Rules</u></strong>

    ProAvalon. All rules are subject to one warning and then increasing ban

      original offence is repeated at the time of the evasion.
    </li>

      For offences where intent is a part of the infraction, it is up to the
      moderators involved to deem whether said intent is beyond reasonable
      doubt.

    <li>
      In fringe situations or situations that are not explicitly covered by this
      rule list, if the mod team agrees that a player has acted against fair
      play or basic decency, the moderators retain full discretion to decide an
      interpretation of the rules (or ideas behind the rules) that they deem
      fair for said situation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://bullyingnoway.gov.au/understanding-bullying">Bullying</a>
